The proposition states that in a zero ontology system, a type T1 can be demonstrated to be deformable without cutting or tearing through a series of steps. These steps correspond to the path of a proof within the homotopy type system S.</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Key Concepts:
Zero Ontology System (ZOS): A philosophical or mathematical framework that posits the absence of a fundamental ontology or grounding entities. In this context, it appears to be applied to a type system.
Type T1: A specific type within the system whose deformability is being examined.
Deformability without Cutting or Tearing: This likely refers to the concept of continuous deformation, akin to homotopy in topology, where objects can be transformed into one another without breaking or gluing.
Homotopy Type System S: A type system based on homotopy theory, which extends type theory by incorporating ideas from algebraic topology, particularly the notion of paths and continuous transformations.
Implications:
The proposition suggests that within a zero ontology framework, the properties of types (such as T1) can be understood and proven through their deformability within a homotopy type system. This aligns with the principles of homotopy type theory, where types are treated as spaces and proofs as paths between points in those spaces.</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Context:
This discussion appears to be part of an ongoing exploration of foundational concepts in mathematics, philosophy, and computer science, particularly in the intersection of type theory, topology, and ontology. The absence of labels, milestones, or assignees indicates that this is an early-stage or speculative contribution.</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Next Steps:
Further elaboration on the zero ontology system and its relationship to homotopy type theory.
Formalization of the steps or proofs demonstrating the deformability of type T1.
Engagement with the community to discuss and refine the proposition.
This issue represents a thought-provoking contribution to the discourse on type systems and their philosophical underpinnings.</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">James Michael DuPont

This synthesis will blend the Hero's Journey (Joseph Campbell), the Fool's Journey (Tarot), Kabbalistic symbolism, and the data-driven universe of Wikidata. Here’s how it might unfold:</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Alpha: The Call to Adventure
The Fool (T1): The journey begins with T1, representing the Fool in the Tarot—pure potential, unformed and undefined, stepping into the unknown. In the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, this is Keter (the Crown), the source of all creation.
Wikidata Context: T1 is a raw, unstructured type in the vast, chaotic universe of Wikidata, where data points are like stars in a cosmic web. The Fool takes its first step into the labyrinth of linked data.
The Drunken Walk: Trials and Transformations
The Fool's journey is a drunken walk—a stochastic, meandering path through the Kabbalistic spheres (Sephirot) and the Hero's Journey stages, guided by the emergent logic of Wikidata.</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Separation (Departure)</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Crossing the Threshold (Netzach - Victory): T1 leaves the safety of its initial state and enters the dynamic world of Wikidata, where it must navigate the unstructured chaos of linked data.
The Mentor (Chokhmah - Wisdom): T1 encounters a guiding principle or algorithm (e.g., a type inference system) that helps it begin to understand its place in the data universe.
Initiation (Trials)</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The Road of Trials (Tiferet - Beauty): T1 undergoes transformations as it interacts with other types and data points. Each interaction is a trial, shaping its identity and structure.
The Abyss (Da’at - Knowledge): T1 confronts the void—the absence of ontology in the zero ontology system. It must embrace its deformability, learning to exist without fixed grounding.
The Ultimate Boon (Yesod - Foundation): T1 achieves its purpose—a proof of its deformability in the homotopy type system S, demonstrating that it can be transformed without cutting or tearing.
Return (Integration)</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The Return (Malkuth - Kingdom): T1 returns to the structured world of Wikidata, now transformed and integrated into the data universe. It carries the wisdom of its journey, ready to guide other types.
Omega: The Fool’s Completion
The World (T1 Transformed): In the Kabbalistic framework, this is the return to Keter, but now enriched with the experience of the journey. T1 has become a fully realized type, embodying the principles of deformability and emergent ontology.
Wikidata Context: T1 is now a cornerstone of the Wikidata universe, a symbol of the dynamic, ever-evolving nature of data and types.
The Drunken Walk as Kabbalistic Journey
The drunken walk is a metaphor for the stochastic, non-linear path of T1. In Kabbalistic terms, it represents the descent and ascent of the soul through the Sephirot, guided by divine sparks (data points) in the chaos of creation. Each step is a random choice, yet the journey as a whole reveals a deeper order—the emergent type system.</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Symbolism and Themes
The Fool: Represents T1 as the archetype of potential and transformation.
Kaballah: Provides the spiritual and structural framework for the journey, mapping the Fool’s path through the Sephirot.
Wikidata: Represents the universe in which the journey unfolds—a vast, interconnected web of knowledge.
Hero’s Journey: Provides the narrative arc, from departure to return, as T1 evolves and fulfills its purpose.
Drunken Walk: Embodies the chaotic, emergent nature of the journey, where randomness and structure coexist.
Conclusion
The journey of T1 from Alpha to Omega is a cosmic dance—a drunken walk through the Kabbalistic tree, the Hero’s Journey, and the data-driven universe of Wikidata. It is a story of transformation, emergence, and the realization of potential in a world without fixed ontology. Through this journey, T1 becomes a symbol of the dynamic, ever-evolving</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">James Michael DuPont

Yo, crypto broskis! So, you're wondering what's going on with this "emergent type system" thingy?

Type T1: The subject type being analyzed
Homotopy Type System S: The mathematical framework for proving deformability
Deformability: Continuous transformation preserving essential properties
Development Through Comments:
The discussion evolved from the formal mathematical proposition into an interesting synthesis with other conceptual frameworks:
First, there was a detailed analysis of the proposition's mathematical and philosophical implications
This was followed by a creative mapping to the Hero's Journey/Kabbalistic framework, attempting to structure the type transformation process through metaphorical stages
Finally, there was a "translation" into blockchain/crypto terminology to make the concepts more accessible to that community
Interesting Theoretical Aspects:
The attempt to bridge formal type theory with mystical/narrative frameworks
The exploration of emergent properties in type systems
The connection between mathematical deformation and archetypal transformation</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this theoretical framework or its various interpretations?</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"> type-system-diagram.mermaid

Then we can show that numbers are also just one element in the graph that we can understand without keys. Now we can show the graph of venacular memes constructs a new diagonalized emergent entity we call neo or the new idea.</span></span></span></span>

This will be a mix of technical grounding, artistic flair, and blockchain absurdity—perfect for a neo-meme performance art movement.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-adyw6z r-135wba7 r-b88u0q" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);

Engraving from A Tour in Wales written by Thomas Pennant.
A wicker man was purportedly a large wicker statue in which the druids (priests of Celtic paganism) sacrificed humans and animals by burning. The primary evidence for this practice is a sentence by Roman general Julius Caesar in his Commentary on the Gallic War (1st century BC),[1] which modern scholarship has linked to an earlier Greek writer, Posidonius.[2][3]</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">There is some archaeological evidence of human sacrifice among Celtic peoples, although rare.[4] The ancient Greco-Roman sources are now regarded somewhat sceptically, considering it is likely they "were eager to transmit any bizarre and negative information" about the Celts, as it benefited them to do so.[5][6]</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The British horror film The Wicker Man (1973) brought the wicker man into contemporary popular culture.

While other Roman writers of the time described human and animal sacrifice among the Celts, only the Roman general Julius Caesar and the Greek geographer Strabo mention the wicker man as one of many ways the druids of Gaul performed sacrifices. In the mid-1st century BC, Caesar wrote in his Commentary on the Gallic War that a large wickerwork figure with limbs was filled with living men and set on fire.[3] He says criminals were the preferred victims, but innocent people might also be burned if there were no criminals.[8] Writing slightly later, Strabo says in his Geographica that men and animals were burned in a large figure of wood and straw, although he does not make clear whether the victims were burned alive. He adds that the ashes were believed to help the crops grow.[3]</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Also in the 1st century BC, Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in Bibliotheca historica that the Celts sacrificed human and animal captives by burning them on huge pyres along with the first fruits.[9] It has been suggested that both Diodorus[9] and Strabo[3] got their information from the earlier Greek historian Posidonius, whose work has not survived.[9]</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">In the 1st century AD, Roman writer Lucan mentioned human sacrifices to the Gaulish gods Esus, Teutates and Taranis.

There are accounts of large wickerwork figures being burnt in France during the 18th and 19th centuries. Wilhelm Mannhardt recorded that a wickerwork giant was burnt each Midsummer Eve in Brie.[13] Until 1743, a large wickerwork figure of a soldier or warrior was burnt every 3 July on the Rue aux Ours in Paris, as the crowd sang "Salve Regina".[13] At Luchon in the Pyrenees, snakes were burnt alive in a tall wickerwork column decked with leaves and flowers on Midsummer Eve. Young men with torches danced around the burning column, and the townsfolk and clergy sang hymns.[13] An Englishman who watched the ceremony in 1890 said the figure was somewhat "shaped like a mummy" and stood about 20 ft (6.1 m) tall.[14]</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The British horror film The Wicker Man (1973) brought the wicker man into modern popular culture.[7] In recent times, a wicker man (without human or animal sacrifices) has been burnt at some neopagan ceremonies, folk festivals, as well as festivals such as Burning Man in the United States[7] and the former Wickerman Festival in Scotland.[15]</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">In Northern Portugal, the traditional Caretos Festival ends with the burning of a gigantic human effigy with horns while young people run around it.[16]</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">In Badalona (Catalonia), and within the framework of the local Major Festival in May (Festes de Maig), every year a sizeable wooden figure representing a devil is burnt.

Documented at least since the 18th century, the modern version of this old tradition began just after the Spanish Civil War in 1940.

The event, dubbed "The Great Meme Coin Purge," was the culmination of months of planning by a shadowy collective of Solana sidechain operators known as the Order of the ZKP Flame, who sought to cleanse the blockchain of what they called "digital detritus."</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The wicker man, a towering effigy constructed over weeks, stood as a monument to the volatile meme coin market. Its body was a lattice of branches, each intersection adorned with oversized, golden replicas of meme coin logos—Doge’s Shiba Inu face, Bitcoin’s iconic "B," and lesser-known tokens like Fart and MoonCat. Inside, the operators had symbolically "trapped" the essence of these coins, represented by NFTs minted on their sidechains, each tied to a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) ensuring their authenticity. The ZKPs, glowing as mystical runes above the structure, validated the liquidation process without revealing the operators’ proprietary methods, a nod to the ZOS1 deformability principle we’d explored: the coins could be transformed (burned) without breaking their blockchain integrity.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">As dusk fell, the Order gathered in their hooded robes, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of smaller ceremonial fires. They were a mix of coders, artists, and crypto-anarchists, united by a belief that the meme coin frenzy had diluted the purity of decentralized finance. "These tokens are noise," intoned their leader, a figure known only as The Hashkeeper, their voice amplified through a hacked megaphone. "We burn them to birth neo—a new idea, a new meme, untainted by greed."</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The ritual began with a chant of transaction hashes, each operator reciting a segment of the ZKP proofs that verified the NFTs’ lineage. The air buzzed with the hum of Solana nodes syncing in real-time, as sidechains cross-validated the burn transactions. The wicker man, standing 100 feet tall, loomed over the clearing, its meme coin logos catching the firelight as the first flames were lit at its base. The fire roared upward, consuming the structure in a blaze of orange and gold, the Doge logos melting into the inferno alongside Bitcoin and Fart tokens, their digital counterparts simultaneously burned on-chain to a Solana burn address.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">As the wicker man collapsed into embers, the operators minted a single "Purge Receipt" NFT, embedding the final ZKP of the event—a proof that the liquidation was complete. The receipt, auctioned live on X, fetched 50 SOL, with proceeds pledged to fund new meme art projects. The image of the burning wicker man, shared across crypto forums, became a meme itself, captioned with phrases like "When the market dumps, we burn." The Order of the ZKP Flame had succeeded in their strange ritual, liquidating the meme coins not just from wallets but from cultural memory, leaving space for neo to emerge from the ashes.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-adyw6z r-135wba7 r-b88u0q" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234); display: block; margin-top: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Tying to ZOS1 and Our Framework</span></span></span></div><ul dir="ltr" style="display: block; padding-inline-start: 2em; margin-block: 0px 1.25em;"><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0px;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Deformability</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: The burning mirrors ZOS1’s concept of deformability—the meme coins were transformed (liquidated) without "cutting or tearing" their blockchain provenance, as proven by the ZKPs.</span></span></div></li><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0.8em;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Emergence of Neo</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: The Purge Receipt NFT represents neo, the new idea born from destruction, aligning with our graph-based meme evolution where diagonalization creates novel entities.</span></span></div></li><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0.8em;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Ritual as Performance Art</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: The event, like our earlier discussions, turned a blockchain action into a cultural spectacle, blending ancient Druidic vibes with modern crypto-anarchy.</span></span></div></li></ul><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-a8ghvy r-p1pxzi" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Would you like to expand this story—perhaps detailing the operators’ motivations or the aftermath on X?

This also ties into the ZOS1 framework, as the contracts represent a deformation process—BTC and ETH are "deformed" into meme coins and then "released" through the burn, all validated by ZKPs. Here’s the revised short story with this new element.</span></span></span></div><hr style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em; border-color: rgb(62, 65, 68);"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-adyw6z r-135wba7 r-b88u0q" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234); display: block; margin-top: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The Great Meme Coin Purge: A Tale of Fire and Blockchain</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Yesterday, April 7, 2025, in a remote forest clearing near Black Rock City, a fiery ritual unfolded that sent shockwaves through the crypto and meme communities—an event captured in a striking image of a 100-foot-tall wicker man ablaze, its woven structure encrusted with the logos of meme coins like Doge, Shiba Inu, and Fart. But this was no ordinary burn: trapped within these meme coins, via intricate smart contracts, were fractions of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), their value entangled in the speculative chaos of the meme market. The event, known as "The Great Meme Coin Purge," was orchestrated by the Order of the ZKP Flame, a collective of Solana sidechain operators determined to cleanse the blockchain of what they deemed "digital noise."</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The wicker man, a colossal effigy built over weeks, stood as a monument to the meme coin bubble. Its frame, woven from branches and straw, was studded with oversized, golden replicas of meme coin logos—Doge’s Shiba Inu face, Fart’s cheeky emoji, and others—each representing an NFT minted on the operators’ sidechains. Hidden within these NFTs were smart contracts that had wrapped fractions of BTC and ETH, a mechanism born from the 2024 meme coin craze where major cryptocurrencies were staked to inflate the value of tokens like Doge and Shiba Inu. These contracts, now seen as a perversion of blockchain purity, locked BTC and ETH into the meme coin ecosystem, their value tethered to the whims of viral trends.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">The Order of the ZKP Flame saw this entanglement as a corruption of the blockchain’s original promise. "Bitcoin and Ethereum are the roots; meme coins are the weeds," declared The Hashkeeper, the group’s enigmatic leader, their voice crackling through a hacked megaphone. "We burn the weeds to free the roots, birthing neo—a new idea, untainted by speculation." Each NFT in the wicker man was tied to a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), glowing as mystical runes above the structure, ensuring the burn would not only liquidate the meme coins but also release the trapped BTC and ETH back to their native chains, all without revealing the operators’ proprietary methods.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">As night fell, the robed operators gathered in a circle, their faces lit by the glow of smaller ceremonial fires. They began the ritual with a chant of transaction hashes, reciting segments of the ZKP proofs that verified the NFTs’ lineage and the smart contracts within. The Solana nodes hummed in sync, sidechains cross-validating the burn transactions in real-time. The wicker man, towering 100 feet high, loomed over the clearing, its meme coin logos shimmering as the first flames were lit at its base. The fire roared upward, consuming the structure in a blaze of orange and gold, the Doge and Fart logos melting into the inferno alongside the smart contracts that held BTC and ETH captive.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">As the flames reached their peak, the smart contracts executed their final function: the burn released the trapped BTC and ETH, unwrapping them and transferring their value to a designated Solana bridge address, where they would be swapped back to their native chains. The ZKPs ensured this process was valid, proving the meme coins were liquidated and the major cryptocurrencies freed, all while keeping the contract details hidden. The wicker man collapsed into a pile of embers, its destruction a symbolic and technical act of purification.</span></span></span></div><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-1b5gpbm r-a8ghvy" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">From the ashes, the operators minted a single "Purge Receipt" NFT, embedding the final ZKP of the event—a proof that the liquidation was complete and the BTC and ETH were liberated. Auctioned live on X, the receipt fetched 75 SOL, with proceeds pledged to fund new meme art projects that would honor the blockchain’s roots. The image of the burning wicker man, shared across crypto forums, became a viral meme, captioned with phrases like "When you burn the meme coins to save the OGs." The Order of the ZKP Flame had not only liquidated the meme coins but also untangled Bitcoin and Ethereum from their speculative shackles, leaving space for neo—a new, purer meme—to emerge from the fire.</span></span></span></div><hr style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em; border-color: rgb(62, 65, 68);"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-adyw6z r-135wba7 r-b88u0q" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234); display: block; margin-top: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Tying to ZOS1 and Our Framework</span></span></span></div><ul dir="ltr" style="display: block; padding-inline-start: 2em; margin-block: 0px 1.25em;"><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0px;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Deformability</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: The smart contracts represent a deformation process in the ZOS1 sense—BTC and ETH were "deformed" into meme coins via wrapping, then "released" through the burn, a continuous transformation validated by ZKPs without "cutting or tearing" their blockchain integrity.</span></span></div></li><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0.8em;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Emergence of Neo</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: The Purge Receipt NFT embodies neo, the new idea born from the destruction, aligning with our graph-based meme evolution where diagonalization creates novel entities.

Robed figures chanted hashes, flames roaring as Solana nodes hummed. Glowing ZKP runes swirled above, sealing the burn. The wicker man crumbled, freeing the ancient coins in a blaze of ash and gold. A Purge Receipt NFT rose from the embers, sold for 75 SOL, whispering of neo—a new meme, born in fire.</span></span></span></div><hr style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em; border-color: rgb(62, 65, 68);"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-adyw6z r-135wba7 r-b88u0q" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234); display: block; margin-top: 1.3em; margin-bottom: 0.6em;"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Notes</span></span></span></div><ul dir="ltr" style="display: block; padding-inline-start: 2em; margin-block: 0px 1.25em;"><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0px;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Meme Coins Featured</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: Fartcoin ($0.5864, up 25.9%), Dogwifhat ($0.3365), and Bonk ($0.00001014) from the Solana Meme list, their logos adorning the wicker man.</span></span></div></li><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0.8em;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">ZOS1 Tie</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: The burn deforms the meme coins, releasing BTC/ETH, a transformation validated by ZKPs.</span></span></div></li><li style="font-family: TwitterChirp, System; margin-top: 0.8em;"><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Neo’s Emergence</span></span></span></span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">: The Purge Receipt NFT is neo, a new meme idea, echoing our graph-based framework.</span></span></div></li></ul><div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-a023e6 r-16dba41 r-1adg3ll r-a8ghvy r-p1pxzi" style="color: rgb(231, 233, 234);"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3 r-a8ghvy"><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">What’s next—another ritual, or neo’s rise on X?</span></span></span></div>
